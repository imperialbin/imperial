# `next-chakra-ts`

#### bootstrap a next.js app with chakra in 20s

## Use this template

You can simply create a new Next app with the following command (emphasis on the -e argument â€“ this tells next to setup from an "example" or template).

```bash
yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/alii/next-chakra-ts
```

Alternatively, you can hit "use this template" on this repo to copy the code into your own repository and clone from there.
