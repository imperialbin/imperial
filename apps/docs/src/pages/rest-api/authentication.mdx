# Authentication

Learn about how IMPERIAL handles authentication. There are two ways to authenticate with the API.

The way you authenticate is through headers. Either send the cookie, or provide an `Authorization` header, like so.

```ts
fetch("https://api/impb.in/v1/users/@me", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    Authorization:
      "imperial_c181MzFhNWFiYTVkM2MwNGU3Y2U4MTRmMTViODNiNjgwYV8xNjc4NTgxNTkwMzQzNzIwOTg",
  },
});
```

## API Key

The API key is a unique identifier for your account. It is used to authenticate all requests to the API. You can find your API key in your user settings.

They look like this

```
imperial_c181MzFhNWFiYTVkM2MwNGU3Y2U4MTRmMTViODNiNjgwYV8xNjc4NTgxNTkwMzQzNzIwOTg
```

Notice the prefix `imperial_`

## Auth Token

The auth token is a unique identifier for your session. It is used to authenticate all requests to the API. They are set in your cookies.

They look like this

```
imperial_auth_c18wMGU0MjVlODM0ZDI1ODNjNmU3YjYxM2Y5OTAxYzhjM18xNjk0OTE5MzQzODE5ODE3MDM
```

Notice the prefix `imperial_auth_`

## Rate Limits

API limits are subjective to the route you are hitting, in most cases you can hit the endpoint 500 times before being rate limited for a minute.

However, on some routes, (namely auth routes) you can only hit those endpoints 10 times every minute.
