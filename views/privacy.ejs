    <h2>Documents</h2>
    <p>When you create a document, we store the following data...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Documents URL: This is the documents ID</li>
      <li>Documents image embed status: This tells us if image embed is enabled</li>

      <li>Documents creator: We store this so we know who to give privileges to</li>

      <li>Documents deletion date: We use this to actually delete the document in the future</li>
      <li>Documents allowed editors: We store the editors so we can give privileges to said users</li>
      <li>Documents encrypted status: We need this so we can tell if a document is encrypted or not</li>

        encrypted is false</li>
      <li>Documents views: We store this so we can tell you how many people viewed your document</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>How do we encrypt documents?</h2>
    <p>We encrypt documents with AES-256 bit encryption. We do not store the password for the document, and instead use
      an initialization vector to actually check if the password is correct. This way its hard to decrypt without the
      password, and is very secure and no passwords are stored. Our decryption and encryption code is all open sourced,
      and you can view it at <a href="https://imperialb.in/git" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
    <br>
    <h2>What happens when I delete a document</h2>
    <p>When you delete a document, the following happens...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The document instantly gets deleted and all of its contents</li>
      <li>If image embeds are enables, the image gets deleted</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>What do we use to store information?</h2>
    <p>We use <a href="https://www.mongodb.com" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>, it is a document-based, no-sql, and general
      purpose database. We have it heavily secured, with 2FA and IP locked access.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How do we encrypt users passwords?</h2>
    <p>We encrypt users passwords with a NodeJS package called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt"
        target="_blank">bcrypt</a>, its a library that helps people hash things, specifically passwords. We for the most
      part frequently update bcrypt, so we have the most up to date encryption. bcrypt, made in the late 90s, has earned
      its reputation over the years. Proving that its reliable and secure.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Our promise</h2>
    <p>We will not sell your user data. Plain simple as that. No matter if you're banned, not confirmed, or any other
      situation, we will not sell your data. We simply just don't have an interest in selling it. Also we're just not a
      dick</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Who sees our user data?</h2>
    <p>The following people would be able to see your user data...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DEVLOOSKIE (Creator and developer of IMPERIAL)</li>
      <li>pxseu (Community developer and admin of IMPERIAL)</li>
